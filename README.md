# Money Plot Labs — Retirement Timeline

> The pure math of financial freedom: three interactive tools that model the full

**Live site:** _<add your deployed URL here — the domain in `CNAME`>_

A zero-backend, client-side web app. Every calculation runs in the browser; nothing
is sent to a server. The math behind each tool is derived from scratch in the
[technical whitepapers](#-the-math) included in this repo.

## What it is

Standard retirement advice leans on rules of thumb ("the 4% rule," "save 15% of
income"). This project replaces the heuristics with explicit math. It answers a
single question — **how many years do I need to work?** — at three increasing levels
of rigor, so you can see how the answer changes as you add realism (variable cash
flows, then market volatility).

All figures are modeled in **real (inflation-adjusted) terms**, so a flat retirement
spending line represents constant purchasing power rather than nominal dollars.

## The three tools

| # | Tool | File | Model | What it answers |
|---|------|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Macro Sandbox** | [`index.html`](index.html) · [`index.js`](index.js) | Deterministic, closed-form | Given a fixed real growth rate, savings, and spending, how many working years until you can retire and hold a legacy floor? |
| 2 | **Cash Flow Planner** | [`LifepathCashFlowSimulator.html`](LifepathCashFlowSimulator.html) · [`lifepath.js`](lifepath.js) | Deterministic, year-by-year | Same question, but with milestone-based income/savings/spending that change across life stages, plus Social Security and windfall events. |
| 3 | **Stress Tester** | [`StressTester.html`](StressTester.html) · [`stresstester.js`](stresstester.js) | Stochastic, Monte Carlo | How robust is a plan to market volatility? Generates percentile fans from historical-return bootstrap and chronological cohort windows. |

The first two are deterministic engines that give you a single, exact trajectory and
build intuition. The Stress Tester adds uncertainty: it samples real historical
returns (1928–2024) to show the *distribution* of outcomes — the same plan can succeed
at the median and still fail at the 10th percentile, and this tool makes that visible.

State for each tool is encoded in the URL, so any scenario can be bookmarked or shared
as a link.

## The math

Each tool is backed by a self-contained whitepaper deriving its model from first
principles. The compiled PDFs and their LaTeX sources live in [`docs/`](docs/).

| Whitepaper | Covers |
|------------|--------|
| [001 — The Pure Math of Financial Freedom](docs/001-the-pure-math-of-financial-freedom.pdf) | The deterministic closed-form solution: linear baseline, then exponential accumulation/decumulation. Underpins the Macro Sandbox. |
| [002 — The Asymmetric Glide Path](docs/002-asymmetric-glide-path.pdf) | Separate accumulation vs. decumulation growth rates and capital-conservation dynamics. |
| [003 — The Stochastic Retirement Framework](docs/003-stochastic-retirement-framework.pdf) | I.i.d. lognormal returns, percentile retirement dates in closed form (Fenton–Wilkinson), and how the analytical model and the Monte Carlo engine cross-check each other. Underpins the Stress Tester. |

LaTeX sources, the plot-generation scripts (`generate_plot*.py`), and the generated
figures are in [`docs/src_docs/`](docs/src_docs/).

### Generating the figures

The whitepaper figures are produced offline by the `generate_plot*.py` scripts using
NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. They are not part of the web app — you only need this if
you want to regenerate or modify the plots.

```bash
# from the repo root
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run a script (writes its PDF into the visual-assets folder)
cd docs/src_docs
python3 generate_plot0.py
```

The resulting PDFs land in `docs/src_docs/visual-assets/`, where the LaTeX sources
pick them up on the next compile.

## Tech stack

- **Vanilla JavaScript** — no framework, no build step.
- **[Chart.js 3.9.1](https://www.chartjs.org/)** — loaded from CDN for all visualizations.
- **Plain CSS** — a single [`styles.css`](styles.css) shared across all three tools.
- **Cloudflare** — deployed as a static site (see [`wrangler.jsonc`](wrangler.jsonc)).
- **Python + Matplotlib** — used offline only, to generate the whitepaper figures.

## Running locally

There is no build step. Because the tools load `styles.css` and the engine scripts by
relative path, serve the folder over HTTP rather than opening the file directly:

```bash
# Python (built in on most systems)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# or Node
npx serve .
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>. The three tools are linked from the navigation bar
at the bottom of each page.

## Deployment

The site is deployed to Cloudflare as static assets. With
[Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) installed:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

The custom domain is configured via `CNAME` and the Cloudflare dashboard.

## Data attribution

Historical return series cover **1928–2024 (97 years)** and are sourced from
[Aswath Damodaran's dataset at NYU Stern](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html).
The **60/40 portfolio** blends 60% S&P 500 with 40% 10-Year US Treasury bond total
returns; all series are deflated by CPI to express returns in real terms.

This project is an educational and illustrative modeling tool, **not financial
advice**. It makes simplifying assumptions (no taxes, no fees, real-terms framing) and
